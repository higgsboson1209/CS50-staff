Scripts for CS50 volunteer staff
Scripts for CS50 volunteer staff The first script for grouping people into sections is provided by Laryn Qi and it helps to club people into sections/classes based on their preferred timings which are then matched with the teachers timing and an optimal time is selected which fits the student schedules as well as the teacher schedules The second script is a data-analytics script which provides anonymous feedback provided byy the students to their teachers and also a summarised analysis for all the reviews given for each SL/Team of teachers
